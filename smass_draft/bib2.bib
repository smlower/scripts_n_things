	abstract = {We analyse the physical properties of a large, homogeneously selected sample of ALMA-located sub-mm galaxies (SMGs) detected in the SCUBA-2 CLS 850-\${\textbackslash}mu\$m map of the UKIDSS/UDS field. This survey, AS2UDS, identified 707 SMGs across the {\textasciitilde}1 sq.deg. field, including {\textasciitilde}17 per cent which are undetected in the optical/near-infrared to \$K\${\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}25.7 mag. We interpret the UV-to-radio data using a physically motivated model, MAGPHYS and determine a median photometric redshift of z=2.61+-0.08, with a 68th percentile range of z=1.8-3.4 and just {\textasciitilde}6 per cent at z{\textgreater}4. The redshift distribution is well fit by a model combining evolution of the gas fraction in halos with the growth of halo mass past a threshold of {\textasciitilde}4x10\${\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, thus SMGs may represent the highly efficient collapse of gas-rich massive halos. Our survey provides a sample of the most massive, dusty galaxies at z{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}1, with median dust and stellar masses of \$M\_d\$=(6.8+-0.3)x10\${\textasciicircum}\{8\}\$M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ (thus, gas masses of {\textasciitilde}10\${\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$) and \$M\_{\textbackslash}ast=\$(1.26+-0.05)x10\${\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. These galaxies have gas fractions of \$f\_\{gas\}=\$0.41+-0.02 with depletion timescales of {\textasciitilde}150Myr. The gas mass function evolution at high masses is consistent with constraints at lower masses from blind CO-surveys, with an increase to z{\textasciitilde}2-3 and then a decline at higher redshifts. The space density and masses of SMGs suggests that almost all galaxies with \$M\_{\textbackslash}ast\${\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}2x10\${\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ have passed through an SMG-like phase. We find no evolution in dust temperature at a constant far-infrared luminosity across z{\textasciitilde}1.5-4. We show that SMGs appear to behave as simple homologous systems in the far-infrared, having properties consistent with a centrally illuminated starburst. Our study provides strong support for an evolutionary link between the active, gas-rich SMG population at z{\textgreater}1 and the formation of massive, bulge-dominated galaxies across the history of the Universe.},

	abstract = {Star-forming galaxies have been found to follow a relatively tight relation between stellar mass (\$M\_\{*\}\$) and star formation rate (SFR), dubbed the `star formation sequence'. A turnover in the sequence has been observed, where galaxies with \$M\_\{*\} {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\} \{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ follow a steeper relation than their higher mass counterparts, suggesting that the low-mass slope is (nearly) linear. In this paper, we characterise the properties of the low-mass end of the star formation sequence between \$7 {\textbackslash}leq {\textbackslash}log M\_\{*\}[\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}] {\textbackslash}leq 10.5\$ at redshift \$0.11 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.91\$. We use the deepest MUSE observations of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field and the Hubble Deep Field South to construct a sample of 179 star-forming galaxies with high signal-to-noise emission lines. Dust-corrected SFRs are determined from H\${\textbackslash}beta\$ \${\textbackslash}lambda 4861\$ and H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ \${\textbackslash}lambda 6563\$. We model the star formation sequence with a Gaussian distribution around a hyperplane between \${\textbackslash}log M\_\{*\}\$, \${\textbackslash}log \{{\textbackslash}rm SFR\}\$, and \${\textbackslash}log (1+z)\$, to simultaneously constrain the slope, redshift evolution, and intrinsic scatter. We find a sub-linear slope for the low-mass regime where \${\textbackslash}log \{{\textbackslash}rm SFR\}[\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}/\{{\textbackslash}rm yr\}] = 0.83{\textasciicircum}\{+0.07\}\_\{-0.06\} {\textbackslash}log M\_\{*\}[\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}] + 1.74{\textasciicircum}\{+0.66\}\_\{-0.68\} {\textbackslash}log (1+z)\$, increasing with redshift. We recover an intrinsic scatter in the relation of \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}rm intr\} = 0.44{\textasciicircum}\{+0.05\}\_\{-0.04\}\$ dex, larger than typically found at higher masses. As both hydrodynamical simulations and (semi-)analytical models typically favour a steeper slope in the low-mass regime, our results provide new constraints on the feedback processes which operate preferentially in low-mass halos.},

	abstract = {We present an analysis of the deepest Herschel images in four major extragalactic fields GOODS-North, GOODS-South, UDS and COSMOS obtained within the GOODS-Herschel and CANDELS-Herschel key programs. The picture provided by 10497 individual far-infrared detections is supplemented by the stacking analysis of a mass-complete sample of 62361 star-forming galaxies from the CANDELS-HST H band-selected catalogs and from two deep ground-based Ks band-selected catalogs in the GOODS-North and the COSMOS-wide fields, in order to obtain one of the most accurate and unbiased understanding to date of the stellar mass growth over the cosmic history. We show, for the first time, that stacking also provides a powerful tool to determine the dispersion of a physical correlation and describe our method called "scatter stacking" that may be easily generalized to other experiments. We demonstrate that galaxies of all masses from z=4 to 0 follow a universal scaling law, the so-called main sequence of star-forming galaxies. We find a universal close-to-linear slope of the logSFR-logM* relation with evidence for a flattening of the main sequence at high masses (log(M*/Msun) {\textgreater} 10.5) that becomes less prominent with increasing redshift and almost vanishes by z{\textasciitilde}2. This flattening may be due to the parallel stellar growth of quiescent bulges in star-forming galaxies. Within the main sequence, we measure a non varying SFR dispersion of 0.3 dex. The specific SFR (sSFR=SFR/M*) of star-forming galaxies is found to continuously increase from z=0 to 4. Finally we discuss the implications of our findings on the cosmic SFR history and show that more than 2/3 of present-day stars must have formed in a regime dominated by the main sequence mode. As a consequence we conclude that, although omnipresent in the distant Universe, galaxy mergers had little impact in shaping the global star formation history over the last 12.5 Gyr.},

The models are constrained to reproduce the average Milky Way extinction curve. The calculations include the effects of single-photon heating. Updated IR absorption properties for the PAHs are presented, that are consistent with observed emission spectra, including those newly obtained by Spitzer Space Telescope. We find a size distribution for the PAHs that results in emission band ratios consistent with observed spectra of the Milky Way and other galaxies. Emission spectra are presented for various intensities of the illuminating starlight. We calculate how the efficiency of emission into different IR bands depends on PAH size; the strong 7.7um emission feature is produced mainly by PAH particles containing {\textless}1000 C atoms. We show how the emission spectrum depends on U, the starlight intensity relative to the local interstellar radiation field. The submm and far-infrared emission is compared to the observed emission from the local interstellar medium. Using a simple distribution function, we calculate the emission spectrum for dust heated by a distribution of starlight intensities, such as occurs within galaxies. The models are parameterized by the PAH mass fraction qpah, the lower cutoff Umin, and the fraction gamma of the dust heated by starlight with U{\textgreater}Umin. We present graphical procedures using IRAC and MIPS photometry to estimate qpah, Umin, and gamma, the fraction f\_PDR of the dust luminosity coming from photodissociation regions with U{\textgreater}100, and the total dust mass Mdust.},

Existing evidence shows that the dust content of nearby galaxies depends not only on their morphology, but also on their luminosity and activity level. A digression is devoted to starbursts in view of their potential relevance for measures of opacity in distant galaxies. Scarcity of coherent multiwavelength datasets hampers our ability to derive reliable obscuration estimates in intermediate and high redshift galaxies. This, in turn, limits the reliability of inferred physical quantities, such as star formation rates, stellar population ages, galaxy luminosity functions, and others.},

	abstract = {The stellar masses, mean ages, metallicities, and star formation histories of galaxies are now commonly estimated via stellar population synthesis (SPS) techniques. SPS relies on stellar evolution calculations from the main sequence to stellar death, stellar spectral libraries, phenomenological dust models, and stellar initial mass functions (IMFs). The present work is the first in a series that explores the impact of uncertainties in key phases of stellar evolution and the IMF on the derived physical properties of galaxies and the expected luminosity evolution for a passively evolving set of stars. A Monte-Carlo Markov-Chain approach is taken to fit near-UV through near-IR photometry of a representative sample of low- and high-redshift galaxies with this new SPS model. Significant results include the following: 1) including uncertainties in stellar evolution, stellar masses at z{\textasciitilde}0 carry errors of {\textasciitilde}0.3 dex at 95\% CL with little dependence on luminosity or color, while at z{\textasciitilde}2, the masses of bright red galaxies are uncertain at the {\textasciitilde}0.6 dex level; 2) either current stellar evolution models, current observational stellar libraries, or both, do not adequately characterize the metallicity-dependence of the thermally-pulsating asymptotic giant branch phase; 3) conservative estimates on the uncertainty of the slope of the IMF in the solar neighborhood imply that luminosity evolution per unit redshift is uncertain at the {\textasciitilde}0.4 mag level in the K-band, which is a substantial source of uncertainty for interpreting the evolution of galaxy populations across time; 4) The more plausible assumption of a distribution of stellar metallicities, rather than a fixed value as is usually assumed, can have significant effects on the interpretation of colors blueward of the V-band.

In the present work we perform a comprehensive calibration of our own flexible SPS (FSPS) model against a suite of data. Several public SPS models are intercompared, including the models of Bruzual \& Charlot (BC03), Maraston (M05) and FSPS. The relative strengths and weaknesses of these models are evaluated, with the following conclusions: 1) The FSPS and BC03 models compare favorably with MC data at all ages, whereas M05 colors are too red and the age-dependence is incorrect; 2) All models yield similar optical and near-IR colors for old metal-poor systems, and yet they all provide poor fits to the integrated J-K and V-K colors of both MW and M31 star clusters; 4) All models predict ugr colors too red, D4000 strengths too strong and Hdelta strengths too weak compared to massive red sequence galaxies, under the assumption that such galaxies are composed solely of old metal-rich stars; 5) FSPS and, to a lesser extent, BC03 can reproduce the optical and near-IR colors of post-starburst galaxies, while M05 cannot. Reasons for these discrepancies are explored. The failure at predicting the ugr colors, D4000, and Hdelta strengths can be explained by some combination of a minority population of metal-poor stars, young stars, blue straggler and/or blue horizontal branch stars, but not by appealing to inadequacies in either theoretical stellar atmospheres or canonical evolutionary phases (e.g., the main sequence turn-off). We emphasize that due to a lack of calibrating star cluster data in regions of the metallicity-age plane relevant for galaxies, all of these models continue to suffer from serious uncertainties that are difficult to quantify.

	abstract = {Galaxy observations are influenced by many physical parameters: stellar masses, star formation rates (SFRs), star formation histories (SFHs), metallicities, dust, black hole activity, and more. As a result, inferring accurate physical parameters requires high-dimensional models which capture or marginalize over this complexity. Here we re-assess inferences of galaxy stellar masses and SFRs using the 14-parameter physical model Prospector-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ built in the Prospector Bayesian inference framework. We fit the photometry of 58,461 galaxies from the 3D-HST catalogs at \$0.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5\$. The resulting stellar masses are \${\textbackslash}sim0.1-0.3\$ dex larger than the fiducial masses while remaining consistent with dynamical constraints. This change is primarily due to the systematically older SFHs inferred with Prospector. The SFRs are \${\textbackslash}sim0.1-1+\$ dex lower than UV+IR SFRs, with the largest offsets caused by emission from "old" (\$t{\textgreater}100\$ Myr) stars. These new inferences lower the observed cosmic star formation rate density by \${\textbackslash}sim0.2\$ dex and increase the observed stellar mass growth by \${\textbackslash}sim 0.1\$ dex, finally bringing these two quantities into agreement and implying an older, more quiescent Universe than found by previous studies at these redshifts. We corroborate these results by showing that the Prospector-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ SFHs are both more physically realistic and are much better predictors of the evolution of the stellar mass function. Finally, we highlight examples of observational data which can break degeneracies in the current model; these observations can be incorporated into priors in future models to produce new \& more accurate physical parameters.},

	abstract = {Nonparametric star formation histories (SFHs) have long promised to be the "gold standard" for galaxy SED modeling as they are flexible enough to describe the full diversity of SFH shapes, whereas parametric models rule out a significant fraction of these shapes \{{\textbackslash}it a priori\}. However, this flexibility isn't fully constrained even with high-quality observations, making it critical to choose a well-motivated prior. Here we use the SED-fitting code Prospector to explore the effect of different nonparametric priors by fitting SFHs to mock UV-IR photometry generated from a diverse set of input SFHs. First, we confirm that nonparametric SFHs recover input SFHs with less bias and return more accurate errors than parametric SFHs. We further find that while nonparametric SFHs robustly recover the overall shape of the input SFH, the primary determinant of the size and shape of the posterior SFR(t) is the choice of prior rather than the photometric noise. As a practical demonstration, we fit the UV-IR photometry of \${\textbackslash}sim\$6000 galaxies from the GAMA survey and measure inter-prior scatters in mass (0.1 dex), SFR\$\_\{100{\textbackslash}; {\textbackslash}mathrm\{Myr\}\}\$ (0.8 dex), and mass-weighted ages (0.2 dex), with the bluest star-forming galaxies showing the most sensitivity. An important distinguishing characteristic for nonparametric models is the characteristic timescale for changes in SFR(t). This difference controls whether galaxies are assembled in bursts or in steady-state star formation, corresponding respectively to (feedback-dominated/accretion-dominated) models of galaxy formation and to (larger/smaller) confidence intervals derived from SED-fitting. High quality spectroscopy has the potential to further distinguish between these proposed models of SFR(t).},

	abstract = {Parametric models for galaxy star-formation histories (SFHs) are widely used, though they are known to impose strong priors on physical parameters. This has consequences for measurements of the galaxy stellar-mass function (GSMF), star-formation-rate density (SFRD) and star-forming main sequence (SFMS). We investigate the effects of the exponentially declining, delayed exponentially declining, lognormal and double power law SFH models using BAGPIPES. We demonstrate that each of these models imposes strong priors on specific star-formation rates (sSFRs), potentially biasing the SFMS, and also imposes a strong prior preference for young stellar populations. We show that stellar mass, SFR and mass-weighted age inferences from high-quality mock photometry vary with the choice of SFH model by at least 0.1, 0.3 and 0.2 dex respectively. However the biases with respect to the true values depend more on the true SFH shape than the choice of model. We also demonstrate that photometric data cannot discriminate between SFH models, meaning it is important to perform independent tests to find well-motivated priors. We finally fit a low-redshift, volume-complete sample of galaxies from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) Survey with each model. We demonstrate that our stellar masses and SFRs at redshift, \$z{\textbackslash}sim0.05\$ are consistent with other analyses. However, our inferred cosmic SFRDs peak at \$z{\textbackslash}sim0.4\$, approximately 6 Gyr later than direct observations suggest, meaning our mass-weighted ages are significantly underestimated. This makes the use of parametric SFH models for understanding mass assembly in galaxies challenging. In a companion paper we consider non-parametric SFH models.},

The fitting has been performed using three models: the Code for Investigating GALaxy Evolution (CIGALE), the GRAphite-SILicate approach (GRASIL), and the Multi-wavelength Analysis of Galaxy PHYSical properties (MAGPHYS). We have analyzed the results of the three codes in terms of the SED shapes, and by comparing the derived quantities with simple "recipes" for stellar mass (Mstar), star-formation rate (SFR), dust mass (Mdust), and monochromatic luminosities. Although the algorithms rely on different assumptions for star-formation history, dust attenuation and dust reprocessing, they all well approximate the observed SEDs and are in generally good agreement for the associated quantities. However, the three codes show very different behavior in the mid-infrared regime, in particular between 25 and 70 micron where there are no observational constraints for the KINGFISH sample. We find that different algorithms give discordant SFR estimates for galaxies with low specific SFR, and that the standard "recipes" for calculating FUV absorption overestimate the extinction compared to the SED-fitting results. Results also suggest that assuming a "standard" constant stellar mass-to-light ratio overestimates Mstar relative to the SED fitting, and we provide new SED-based formulations for estimating Mstar from WISE W1 (3.4 micron) luminosities and colors. From a Principal Component Analysis of Mstar, SFR, Mdust, and O/H, we reproduce previous scaling relations among Mstar, SFR, and O/H, and find that Mdust can be predicted to within roughly 0.3 dex using only Mstar and SFR.},

However, galaxy simulations can provide a means of testing SED modelling techniques. Here, we present a numerical experiment in which we apply the SED modelling code MAGPHYS to ultraviolet–millimetre synthetic photometry generated from hydrodynamical simulations of an isolated disc galaxy and a major galaxy merger by performing three-dimensional dust radiative transfer. We compare the properties inferred from the SED modelling with the true values and ﬁnd that MAGPHYS recovers most physical parameters of the simulated galaxies well. In particular, it recovers consistent parameters irrespective of the viewing angle, with smoothly varying results for neighbouring time steps of the simulation, even though each viewing angle and time step is modelled independently. The notable exception to this rule occurs when we use a Small Magellanic Cloud-type intrinsic dust extinction curve in the radiative transfer calculations. In this case, the two-component dust model used by MAGPHYS is unable to effectively correct for the attenuation of the simulated galaxies, which leads to potentially signiﬁcant errors (although we obtain only marginally acceptable ﬁts in this case). Overall, our results give conﬁdence in the ability of SED modelling to infer physical properties of galaxies, albeit with some caveats.},

Model predictions and ﬁtting procedures have improved signiﬁcantly over this time, attempting to keep up with the vastly increased volume and quality of available data. We review here the ﬁeld of SED ﬁtting, describing the modelling of ultraviolet to infrared galaxy SEDs, the creation of multiwavelength data sets, and the methods used to ﬁt model SEDs to observed galaxy data sets. We touch upon the achievements and challenges in the major ingredients of SED ﬁtting, with a special emphasis on describing the interplay between the quality of the available data, the quality of the available models, and the best ﬁtting technique to use in order to obtain a realistic measurement as well as realistic uncertainties. We conclude that SED ﬁtting can be used eﬀectively to derive a range of physical properties of galaxies, such as redshift, stellar masses, star formation rates, dust masses, and metallicities, with care taken not to over-interpret the available data. Yet there still exist many issues such as estimating the age of the oldest stars in a galaxy, ﬁner details of dust properties and dust-star geometry, and the inﬂuences of poorly understood, luminous stellar types and phases. The challenge for the coming years will be to improve both the models and the observational data sets to resolve these uncertainties.

We improve the Dense Basis SFH reconstruction method of Iyer \& Gawiser (2017), introducing a nonparametric description of the SFH based on the lookback times at which a galaxy assembles certain quantiles of its stellar mass. The method uses Gaussian Processes to create smooth SFHs that are independent of any functional form, with a flexible number of parameters that is adjusted to extract the maximum possible amount of SFH information from the SEDs being fit. We apply the method to reconstruct the SFHs of 48,791 galaxies with \$H{\textless}25\$ at \$0.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.0\$ across the five CANDELS fields. Using these SFHs, we study the evolution of galaxies as they grow more massive over cosmic time. We quantify the fraction of galaxies that show multiple major episodes of star formation, finding that the median time between two peaks of star formation is \${\textbackslash}sim 0.42\_\{-0.10\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.15\}t\_\{univ\}\$ Gyr, where \$t\_\{univ\}\$ is the age of the universe at a given redshift and remains roughly constant with stellar mass. Correlating SFHs with morphology, we find that studying the median SFHs of galaxies at \$0.5{\textless}z{\textless}1.0\$ at the same mass (\$10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textless} M\_* {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}\{10.5\}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$) allows us to compare the timescales on which the SFHs decline for different morphological classifications, ranging from \$0.60{\textasciicircum}\{-0.54\}\_\{+1.54\}\$ Gyr for galaxies with spiral arms to \$2.50{\textasciicircum}\{-1.50\}\_\{+2.25\}\$ Gyr for spheroids.

This is done using basis star formation histories (SFHs) chosen by comparing the goodness-of-ﬁt of mock galaxy SEDs to the goodness-of-reconstruction of their SFHs. We train and validate the method using a sample of realistic SFHs at z=1 drawn from stochastic realizations, semi-analytic models, and a cosmological hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulation.

Of the six parametrizations of SFHs considered, we adopt linear-exponential, besselexponential, log-normal, and Gaussian SFHs, and reject the traditional parametrizations of constant (Top-Hat) and exponential SFHs. We quantify the bias and scatter of each parametrization. 15\% of galaxies in our CANDELS sample exhibit multiple episodes of star formation, with this fraction decreasing above M* {\textgreater} 109.5 M. About 40\% of the CANDELS galaxies have SFHs whose maximum occurs at or near the epoch of observation.

Interpreting these data is a challenge for models: many studies have shown that properties derived from modeling galaxy photometry are uncertain by a factor of two or more, and yet answering key questions in the field now requires higher accuracy than this. Here, we present a new model framework specifically designed for these complexities. Our model, Prospector-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$, includes dust attenuation and re-radiation, a flexible attenuation curve, nebular emission, stellar metallicity, and a 6-component nonparametric star formation history. The flexibility and range of the parameter space, coupled with MCMC sampling within the Prospector inference framework, is designed to provide unbiased parameters and realistic error bars. We assess the accuracy of the model with aperture-matched optical spectroscopy, which was excluded from the fits. We compare spectral features predicted solely from fits to the broadband photometry to the observed spectral features. Our model predicts H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ luminosities with a scatter of \${\textbackslash}sim\$0.18 dex and an offset of \${\textbackslash}sim\$0.1 dex across a wide range of morphological types and stellar masses. This agreement is remarkable, as the H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ luminosity is dependent on accurate star formation rates, dust attenuation, and stellar metallicities. The model also accurately predicts dust-sensitive Balmer decrements, spectroscopic stellar metallicities, PAH mass fractions, and the age- and metallicity-sensitive features D\$\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{n\}\}\$4000 and H\${\textbackslash}delta\$. Although the model passes all these tests, we caution that we have not yet assessed its performance at higher redshift or the accuracy of recovered stellar masses.},

	abstract = {The estimated stellar masses of galaxies are widely used to characterize how the galaxy population evolves over cosmic time. If stellar masses can be estimated in a robust manner, free from any bias, global diagnostics such as the stellar mass function can be used to constrain the physics of galaxy formation. We explore how galaxy stellar masses, estimated by ﬁtting broad-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with stellar population models, can be biased as a result of commonly adopted assumptions for the star formation and chemical enrichment histories, recycled fractions and dust attenuation curves of galaxies. We apply the observational technique of broad-band SED ﬁtting to model galaxy SEDs calculated by the theoretical galaxy formation model GALFORM, isolating the effect of each of these assumptions. We ﬁnd that, averaged over the entire galaxy population, the common assumption of exponentially declining star formation histories does not, by itself, adversely affect stellar mass estimation. However, we also show that this result does not hold when considering galaxies that have undergone a recent burst of star formation. We show that ﬁxing the metallicity in SED ﬁtting or using sparsely sampled metallicity grids can introduce mass-dependent systematics into stellar mass estimates. We ﬁnd that the common assumption of a star–dust geometry corresponding to a uniform foreground dust screen can cause the stellar masses of dusty model galaxies to be signiﬁcantly underestimated. Finally, we show that stellar mass functions recovered by applying SED ﬁtting to model galaxies at high redshift can differ signiﬁcantly in both shape and normalization from the intrinsic mass functions predicted by a given model. In particular, the effects of dust can reduce the normalization at the high-mass end by up to 0.6 dex in some cases. Given these differences, our methodology of using stellar masses estimated from model galaxy SEDs offers a new, self-consistent way to compare model predictions with observations. We conclude that great care should be taken when comparing theoretical galaxy formation models to observational results based on the estimated stellar masses of high-redshift galaxies.},

	abstract = {We present dynesty, a public, open-source, Python package to estimate Bayesian posteriors and evidences (marginal likelihoods) using Dynamic Nested Sampling. By adaptively allocating samples based on posterior structure, Dynamic Nested Sampling has the benefits of Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms that focus exclusively on posterior estimation while retaining Nested Sampling's ability to estimate evidences and sample from complex, multi-modal distributions. We provide an overview of Nested Sampling, its extension to Dynamic Nested Sampling, the algorithmic challenges involved, and the various approaches taken to solve them. We then examine dynesty's performance on a variety of toy problems along with several astronomical applications. We find in particular problems dynesty can provide substantial improvements in sampling efficiency compared to popular MCMC approaches in the astronomical literature. More detailed statistical results related to Nested Sampling are also included in the Appendix.},

	abstract = {We derive stellar metallicities, light-weighted ages and stellar masses for a magnitude-limited sample of 175,128 galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release Two (SDSS DR2). We compute median-likelihood estimates of these parameters using a large library of model spectra at medium-high resolution, covering a comprehensive range of star formation histories. The constraints we derive are set by the simultaneous fit of five spectral absorption features, which are well reproduced by our population synthesis models. By design, these constraints depend only weakly on the alpha/Fe element abundance ratio. Our sample includes galaxies of all types spanning the full range in star formation activity, from dormant early-type to actively star-forming galaxies. We show that, in the mean, galaxies follow a sequence of increasing stellar metallicity, age and stellar mass at increasing 4000AA-break strength (D4000). For galaxies of intermediate mass, stronger Balmer absorption at fixed D4000 is associated with higher metallicity and younger age. We investigate how stellar metallicity and age depend on total galaxy stellar mass. Low-mass galaxies are typically young and metal-poor, massive galaxies old and metal-rich, with a rapid transition between these regimes over the stellar mass range 3x10{\textasciicircum}9{\textless}M/Msun{\textless}3x10{\textasciicircum}10. Both high- and low-concentration galaxies follow these relations, but there is a large dispersion in stellar metallicity at fixed stellar mass, especially for low-concentration galaxies of intermediate mass. Despite the large scatter, the relation between stellar metallicity and stellar mass is similar to the correlation between gas-phase oxygen abundance and stellar mass for star-forming galaxies.

	abstract = {We explore the dependence of galaxy stellar population properties that are derived from broad-band spectral energy distribution ﬁtting – such as age, stellar mass, dust reddening, etc. – on a variety of parameters, such as star formation histories, age grid, metallicity, initial mass function (IMF), dust reddening and reddening law, ﬁlter setup and wavelength coverage. Mock galaxies are used as test particles. We conﬁrm our earlier results based on real z = 2 galaxies, that usually adopted τ -models lead to overestimate the star formation rate and to underestimate the stellar mass. Here, we show that – for star-forming galaxies – galaxy ages, masses and reddening can be well determined simultaneously only when the correct star formation history is identiﬁed. This is the case for inverted-τ models at high-z, for which we ﬁnd that the mass recovery (at ﬁxed IMF) is as good as ∼0.04 dex. However, since the right star formation history is usually unknown, we quantify the offsets generated by adopting standard ﬁtting setups. Stellar masses are generally underestimated, which results from underestimating the age. For mixed ﬁtting setups with a variety of star formation histories the median mass recovery at z ∼ 2–3 is as decent as ∼0.1 dex (at ﬁxed IMF), albeit with large scatter. The situation worsens towards lower redshifts, because of the variety of possible star formation histories and ages. At z ∼ 0.5 the stellar mass can be underestimated by as much as ∼0.6 dex (at ﬁxed IMF). A practical trick to improve upon this ﬁgure is to exclude reddening from the ﬁtting parameters, as this helps to avoid unrealistically young and dusty solutions. Stellar masses are underestimated by a smaller amount (∼0.3 dex at z ∼ 0.5). Reddening and the star formation rate should then be determined via a separate ﬁtting. As expected, the recovery of properties is better for passive galaxies, for which e.g. the mass can be fully recovered (within ∼0.01 dex at ﬁxed IMF) when using a ﬁtting setup including metallicity effects. In both cases of star-forming as well as passive galaxies, the recovery of physical parameters is dependent on the spectral range involved in the ﬁtting. We ﬁnd that a coverage from the rest-frame ultraviolet to the rest-frame near-infrared appears to be optimal. We also quantify the effect of narrowing the wavelength coverage or adding and removing ﬁlter bands, which can be useful for planning observational surveys. Finally, we provide scaling relations that allow the transformation of stellar masses obtained using different template ﬁtting setups and stellar population models.},

	abstract = {Photometric data of galaxies covering the rest-frame wavelength range from far-UV to far-IR make it possible to derive galaxy properties with a high reliability by fitting the attenuated stellar emission and the related dust emission at the same time. For this purpose we wrote the code CIGALE (Code Investigating GALaxy Emission) that uses model spectra composed of the Maraston (or PEGASE) stellar population models, synthetic attenuation functions based on a modified Calzetti law, spectral line templates, the Dale \& Helou dust emission models, and optional spectral templates of obscured AGN. Depending on the input redshifts, filter fluxes are computed for the model set and compared to the galaxy photometry by carrying out a Bayesian-like analysis. CIGALE was tested by analysing 39 nearby galaxies selected from SINGS. The reliability of the different model parameters was evaluated by studying the resulting expectation values and their standard deviations in relation to the input model grid. Moreover, the influence of the filter set and the quality of photometric data on the code results was estimated. For up to 17 filters between 0.15 and 160 mum, we find robust results for the mass, star formation rate, effective age of the stellar population at 4000 A, bolometric luminosity, luminosity absorbed by dust, and attenuation in the far-UV. A study of the mutual relations between the reliable properties confirms the dependence of star formation activity on morphology in the local Universe and indicates a significant drop in this activity at about 10{\textasciicircum}11 M\_sol towards higher total stellar masses. The dustiest sample galaxies are present in the same mass range. [abridged]},

	abstract = {Establishing the stellar masses (M*), and hence specific star-formation rates (sSFRs) of submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) is crucial for determining their role in the cosmic galaxy/star formation. However, there is as yet no consensus over the typical M* of SMGs. Specifically, even for the same set of SMGs, the reported average M* have ranged over an order of magnitude, from {\textasciitilde}5x10{\textasciicircum}10 Mo to {\textasciitilde}5x10{\textasciicircum}11 Mo. Here we study how different methods of analysis can lead to such widely varying results. We find that, contrary to recent claims in the literature, potential contamination of IRAC 3-8 um photometry from hot dust associated with an active nucleus is not the origin of the published discrepancies in derived M*. Instead, we expose in detail how inferred M* depends on assumptions made in the photometric fitting, and quantify the individual and cumulative effects of different choices of initial mass function, different brands of evolutionary synthesis models, and different forms of assumed star-formation history. We review current observational evidence for and against these alternatives as well as clues from the hydrodynamical simulations, and conclude that, for the most justifiable choices of these model inputs, the average M* of SMGs is {\textasciitilde}2x10{\textasciicircum}11 Mo. We also confirm that this number is perfectly reasonable in the light of the latest measurements of their dynamical masses, and the evolving M* function of the overall galaxy population. M* of this order imply that the average sSFR of SMGs is comparable to that of other star-forming galaxies at z{\textgreater}2, at 2-3 Gyr{\textasciicircum}-1. This supports the view that, while rare outliers may be found at any M*, most SMGs simply form the top end of the main-sequence of star-forming galaxies at these redshifts. Conversely, this argues strongly against the viewpoint that SMGs are extreme pathological objects, of little relevance in the cosmic history of star-formation.},

In our model, dust forms in stellar ejecta, grows by the accretion of metals, and is destroyed by thermal sputtering and supernovae. Our simulation reproduces the observed dust mass function at z=0, but modestly under-predicts the mass function by {\textasciitilde}x3 at z {\textasciitilde} 1-2. The z=0 DGR vs metallicity relationship shows a tight positive correlation for star-forming galaxies, while it is uncorrelated for quenched systems. There is little evolution in the DGR-metallicity relationship between z=0-6. We use machine learning techniques to search for the galaxy physical properties that best correlate with the DGR and DTM. We find that the DGR is primarily correlated with the gas-phase metallicity, though correlations with the depletion timescale, stellar mass and gas fraction are non-negligible. We provide a crude fitting relationship for DGR and DTM vs. the gas-phase metallicity, along with a public code package that estimates the DGR and DTM given a set of galaxy physical properties.},
