	abstract = {Galaxy observations are influenced by many physical parameters: stellar masses, star formation rates ({SFRs}), star formation histories ({SFHs}), metallicities, dust, black hole activity, and more. As a result, inferring accurate physical parameters requires high-dimensional models which capture or marginalize over this complexity. Here we re-assess inferences of galaxy stellar masses and {SFRs} using the 14-parameter physical model Prospector-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ built in the Prospector Bayesian inference framework. We fit the photometry of 58,461 galaxies from the 3D-{HST} catalogs at \$0.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5\$. The resulting stellar masses are \${\textbackslash}sim0.1-0.3\$ dex larger than the fiducial masses while remaining consistent with dynamical constraints. This change is primarily due to the systematically older {SFHs} inferred with Prospector. The {SFRs} are \${\textbackslash}sim0.1-1+\$ dex lower than {UV}+{IR} {SFRs}, with the largest offsets caused by emission from "old" (\$t{\textgreater}100\$ Myr) stars. These new inferences lower the observed cosmic star formation rate density by \${\textbackslash}sim0.2\$ dex and increase the observed stellar mass growth by \${\textbackslash}sim 0.1\$ dex, finally bringing these two quantities into agreement and implying an older, more quiescent Universe than found by previous studies at these redshifts. We corroborate these results by showing that the Prospector-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ {SFHs} are both more physically realistic and are much better predictors of the evolution of the stellar mass function. Finally, we highlight examples of observational data which can break degeneracies in the current model; these observations can be incorporated into priors in future models to produce new \& more accurate physical parameters.},

	shorttitle = {How to measure galaxy star formation histories {II}},
	abstract = {Nonparametric star formation histories ({SFHs}) have long promised to be the "gold standard" for galaxy {SED} modeling as they are flexible enough to describe the full diversity of {SFH} shapes, whereas parametric models rule out a significant fraction of these shapes \{{\textbackslash}it a priori\}. However, this flexibility isn't fully constrained even with high-quality observations, making it critical to choose a well-motivated prior. Here we use the {SED}-fitting code Prospector to explore the effect of different nonparametric priors by fitting {SFHs} to mock {UV}-{IR} photometry generated from a diverse set of input {SFHs}. First, we confirm that nonparametric {SFHs} recover input {SFHs} with less bias and return more accurate errors than parametric {SFHs}. We further find that while nonparametric {SFHs} robustly recover the overall shape of the input {SFH}, the primary determinant of the size and shape of the posterior {SFR}(t) is the choice of prior rather than the photometric noise. As a practical demonstration, we fit the {UV}-{IR} photometry of \${\textbackslash}sim\$6000 galaxies from the {GAMA} survey and measure inter-prior scatters in mass (0.1 dex), {SFR}\$\_\{100{\textbackslash}; {\textbackslash}mathrm\{Myr\}\}\$ (0.8 dex), and mass-weighted ages (0.2 dex), with the bluest star-forming galaxies showing the most sensitivity. An important distinguishing characteristic for nonparametric models is the characteristic timescale for changes in {SFR}(t). This difference controls whether galaxies are assembled in bursts or in steady-state star formation, corresponding respectively to (feedback-dominated/accretion-dominated) models of galaxy formation and to (larger/smaller) confidence intervals derived from {SED}-fitting. High quality spectroscopy has the potential to further distinguish between these proposed models of {SFR}(t).},

	shorttitle = {How to measure galaxy star-formation histories I},
	abstract = {Parametric models for galaxy star-formation histories ({SFHs}) are widely used, though they are known to impose strong priors on physical parameters. This has consequences for measurements of the galaxy stellar-mass function ({GSMF}), star-formation-rate density ({SFRD}) and star-forming main sequence ({SFMS}). We investigate the effects of the exponentially declining, delayed exponentially declining, lognormal and double power law {SFH} models using {BAGPIPES}. We demonstrate that each of these models imposes strong priors on specific star-formation rates ({sSFRs}), potentially biasing the {SFMS}, and also imposes a strong prior preference for young stellar populations. We show that stellar mass, {SFR} and mass-weighted age inferences from high-quality mock photometry vary with the choice of {SFH} model by at least 0.1, 0.3 and 0.2 dex respectively. However the biases with respect to the true values depend more on the true {SFH} shape than the choice of model. We also demonstrate that photometric data cannot discriminate between {SFH} models, meaning it is important to perform independent tests to find well-motivated priors. We finally fit a low-redshift, volume-complete sample of galaxies from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly ({GAMA}) Survey with each model. We demonstrate that our stellar masses and {SFRs} at redshift, \$z{\textbackslash}sim0.05\$ are consistent with other analyses. However, our inferred cosmic {SFRDs} peak at \$z{\textbackslash}sim0.4\$, approximately 6 Gyr later than direct observations suggest, meaning our mass-weighted ages are significantly underestimated. This makes the use of parametric {SFH} models for understanding mass assembly in galaxies challenging. In a companion paper we consider non-parametric {SFH} models.},

	abstract = {We examine the star formation histories ({SFHs}) of galaxies in smoothed particle hydrodynamics ({SPH}) simulations, compare them to parametric models that are commonly used in fitting observed galaxy spectral energy distributions, and examine the efficacy of these parametric models as practical tools for recovering the physical parameters of galaxies. The commonly used tau-model, with {SFR} {\textasciitilde} exp(-t/tau), provides a poor match to the {SFH} of our {SPH} galaxies, with a mismatch between early and late star formation that leads to systematic errors in predicting colours and stellar mass-to-light ratios. A one-parameter lin-exp model, with {SFR} {\textasciitilde} t*exp(-t/tau), is much more successful on average, but it fails to match the late-time behavior of the bluest, most actively star-forming galaxies and the passive, "red and dead" galaxies. We introduce a 4-parameter model, which transitions from lin-exp to a linear ramp after a transition time, which describes our simulated galaxies very well. We test the ability of these parametrised models to recover (at z=0, 0.5, and 1) the stellar mass-to-light ratios, specific star formation rates, and stellar population ages from the galaxy colours, computed from the full {SPH} star formation histories using the {FSPS} code of Conroy et al. (2009). Fits with tau-models systematically overestimate M/L by {\textasciitilde} 0.2 dex, overestimate population ages by {\textasciitilde} 1-2 Gyr, and underestimate {sSFR} by {\textasciitilde} 0.05 dex. Fits with lin-exp are less biased on average, but the 4-parameter model yields the best results for the full range of galaxies. Marginalizing over the free parameters of the 4-parameter model leads to slightly larger statistical errors than 1-parameter fits but essentially removes all systematic biases, so this is our recommended procedure for fitting real galaxies.},

	abstract = {Context. Measuring how the physical properties of galaxies change across cosmic times is essential to understand galaxy formation and evolution. With the advent of numerous ground-based and space-borne instruments launched over the past few decades we now have exquisite multi-wavelength observations of galaxies from the {FUV} to the radio domain. To tap into this mine of data and obtain new insight into the formation and evolution of galaxies, it is essential that we are able to extract information from their {SED}. Aims. We present a completely new implementation of {CIGALE}. Written in python, its main aims are to easily and efficiently model the {FUV} to radio spectrum of galaxies and estimate their physical properties such as star formation rate, attenuation, dust luminosity, stellar mass, and many other physical quantities. Methods. To compute the spectral models, {CIGALE} builds composite stellar populations from simple stellar populations combined with highly flexible star formation histories, calculates the emission from gas ionised by massive stars, and attenuates both the stars and the ionised gas with a highly flexible attenuation curve. Based on an energy balance principle, the absorbed energy is then re-emitted by the dust in the mid- and far-infrared domains while thermal and non-thermal components are also included, extending the spectrum far into the radio range. A large grid of models is then fitted to the data and the physical properties are estimated through the analysis of the likelihood distribution. Results. {CIGALE} is a versatile and easy-to-use tool that makes full use of the architecture of multi-core computers, building grids of millions of models and analysing samples of thousands of galaxies, both at high speed. Beyond fitting the {SEDs} of galaxies and parameter estimations, it can also be used as a model-generation tool or serve as a library to build new applications.},

The fitting has been performed using three models: the Code for Investigating {GALaxy} Evolution ({CIGALE}), the {GRAphite}-{SILicate} approach ({GRASIL}), and the Multi-wavelength Analysis of Galaxy {PHYSical} properties ({MAGPHYS}). We have analyzed the results of the three codes in terms of the {SED} shapes, and by comparing the derived quantities with simple "recipes" for stellar mass (Mstar), star-formation rate ({SFR}), dust mass (Mdust), and monochromatic luminosities. Although the algorithms rely on different assumptions for star-formation history, dust attenuation and dust reprocessing, they all well approximate the observed {SEDs} and are in generally good agreement for the associated quantities. However, the three codes show very different behavior in the mid-infrared regime, in particular between 25 and 70 micron where there are no observational constraints for the {KINGFISH} sample. We find that different algorithms give discordant {SFR} estimates for galaxies with low specific {SFR}, and that the standard "recipes" for calculating {FUV} absorption overestimate the extinction compared to the {SED}-fitting results. Results also suggest that assuming a "standard" constant stellar mass-to-light ratio overestimates Mstar relative to the {SED} fitting, and we provide new {SED}-based formulations for estimating Mstar from {WISE} W1 (3.4 micron) luminosities and colors. From a Principal Component Analysis of Mstar, {SFR}, Mdust, and O/H, we reproduce previous scaling relations among Mstar, {SFR}, and O/H, and find that Mdust can be predicted to within roughly 0.3 dex using only Mstar and {SFR}.},

Attenuation curve slopes and {UV} bump strengths are reasonably well constrained independently from one another. We ﬁnd that Al {AV} attenuation curves exhibit a very wide range of slopes that are on average as steep as the curve slope of the Small Magellanic Cloud ({SMC}). The slope is a strong function of optical opacity. Opaque galaxies have shallower curves—in agreement with recent radiative transfer models. The dependence of slopes on the opacity produces an apparent dependence on stellar mass: more massive galaxies have shallower slopes. Attenuation curves exhibit a wide range of {UV} bump amplitudes, from none to Milky Way ({MW})-like, with an average strength one-third that of the {MW} bump. Notably, local analogs of high-redshift galaxies have an average curve that is somewhat steeper than the {SMC} curve, with a modest {UV} bump that can be, to ﬁrst order, ignored, as its effect on the near-{UV} magnitude is 0.1 mag. Neither the slopes nor the strengths of the {UV} bump depend on gas-phase metallicity. Functional forms for attenuation laws are presented for normal star-forming galaxies, high-z analogs, and quiescent galaxies.

We model galaxies over three orders of magnitude in stellar mass, ranging from Milky Way–like systems to massive galaxies at high redshift. Critically, for these calculations, we employ a constant underlying dust extinction law in all cases and examine how the role of geometry and radiative transfer effects impacts the resultant attenuation curves. Our main results follow. Despite our usage of a constant dust extinction curve, we ﬁnd dramatic variations in the derived attenuation laws. The slopes of normalized attenuation laws depend primarily on the complexities of star-to-dust geometry. Increasing fractions of unobscured young stars ﬂatten normalized curves, while increasing fractions of unobscured old stars steepen curves. Similar to the slopes of our model attenuation laws, we ﬁnd dramatic variation in the 2175 Å ultraviolet bump strength, including a subset of curves with little to no bump. These bump strengths are primarily inﬂuenced by the fraction of unobscured O and B stars in our model, with the impact of scattered light having only a secondary effect. Taken together, these results lead to a natural relationship between the attenuation curve slope and 2175 Å bump strength. Finally, we apply these results to a 25 Mpc h−1 box cosmological hydrodynamic simulation in order to model the expected dispersion in attenuation laws at integer redshifts from z=0 to 6. A signiﬁcant dispersion is expected at low redshifts and decreases toward z=6. We provide tabulated results for the best-ﬁt median attenuation curve at all redshifts.},

Here, we present a numerical experiment in which we apply the {SED} modelling code {MAGPHYS} to ultraviolet–millimetre synthetic photometry generated from hydrodynamical simulations of an isolated disc galaxy and a major galaxy merger by performing three-dimensional dust radiative transfer. We compare the properties inferred from the {SED} modelling with the true values and ﬁnd that {MAGPHYS} recovers most physical parameters of the simulated galaxies well. In particular, it recovers consistent parameters irrespective of the viewing angle, with smoothly varying results for neighbouring time steps of the simulation, even though each viewing angle and time step is modelled independently. The notable exception to this rule occurs when we use a Small Magellanic Cloud-type intrinsic dust extinction curve in the radiative transfer calculations. In this case, the two-component dust model used by {MAGPHYS} is unable to effectively correct for the attenuation of the simulated galaxies, which leads to potentially signiﬁcant errors (although we obtain only marginally acceptable ﬁts in this case). Overall, our results give conﬁdence in the ability of {SED} modelling to infer physical properties of galaxies, albeit with some caveats.},

Previous studies have shown that a host of factors conspire to maintain a tight and linear {FIRC}, despite many models predicting deviation. This discrepancy between expectations and observations is concerning since a linear {FIRC} underpins the use of radio luminosity as a star-formation rate indicator. Using {LOFAR} 150 {MHz} , {FIRST} 1.4 {GHz} , and Herschel infrared luminosities derived from the new {LOFAR}/H-{ATLAS} catalogue, we investigate possible variation in the monochromatic ( 250 μm) {FIRC} at low and high radio frequencies. We use statistical techniques to probe the {FIRC} for an optically selected sample of 4082 emission-line classiﬁed star-forming galaxies as a function of redshift, effective dust temperature, stellar mass, speciﬁc star formation rate, and mid-infrared colour (an empirical proxy for speciﬁc star formation rate). Although the average {FIRC} at high radio frequency is consistent with expectations based on a standard power-law radio spectrum, the average correlation at 150 {MHz} is not. We see evidence for redshift evolution of the {FIRC} at 150 {MHz}, and ﬁnd that the {FIRC} varies with stellar mass, dust temperature, and speciﬁc star formation rate, whether the latter is probed using {MAGPHYS} ﬁtting, or using mid-infrared colour as a proxy. We can explain the variation, to within 1σ , seen in the {FIRC} over mid-infrared colour by a combination of dust temperature, redshift, and stellar mass using a Bayesian partial correlation technique.},

Model predictions and ﬁtting procedures have improved signiﬁcantly over this time, attempting to keep up with the vastly increased volume and quality of available data. We review here the ﬁeld of {SED} ﬁtting, describing the modelling of ultraviolet to infrared galaxy {SEDs}, the creation of multiwavelength data sets, and the methods used to ﬁt model {SEDs} to observed galaxy data sets. We touch upon the achievements and challenges in the major ingredients of {SED} ﬁtting, with a special emphasis on describing the interplay between the quality of the available data, the quality of the available models, and the best ﬁtting technique to use in order to obtain a realistic measurement as well as realistic uncertainties. We conclude that {SED} ﬁtting can be used eﬀectively to derive a range of physical properties of galaxies, such as redshift, stellar masses, star formation rates, dust masses, and metallicities, with care taken not to over-interpret the available data. Yet there still exist many issues such as estimating the age of the oldest stars in a galaxy, ﬁner details of dust properties and dust-star geometry, and the inﬂuences of poorly understood, luminous stellar types and phases. The challenge for the coming years will be to improve both the models and the observational data sets to resolve these uncertainties. The present review will be made available on an interactive, moderated web page (sedﬁtting.org), where the community can access and change the text.

	abstract = {The star formation histories ({SFHs}) of galaxies contain imprints of the physical processes responsible for regulating star formation during galaxy growth and quenching. We improve the Dense Basis {SFH} reconstruction method of Iyer \& Gawiser (2017), introducing a nonparametric description of the {SFH} based on the lookback times at which a galaxy assembles certain quantiles of its stellar mass. The method uses Gaussian Processes to create smooth {SFHs} that are independent of any functional form, with a flexible number of parameters that is adjusted to extract the maximum possible amount of {SFH} information from the {SEDs} being fit. We apply the method to reconstruct the {SFHs} of 48,791 galaxies with \$H{\textless}25\$ at \$0.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.0\$ across the five {CANDELS} fields. Using these {SFHs}, we study the evolution of galaxies as they grow more massive over cosmic time. We quantify the fraction of galaxies that show multiple major episodes of star formation, finding that the median time between two peaks of star formation is \${\textbackslash}sim 0.42\_\{-0.10\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.15\}t\_\{univ\}\$ Gyr, where \$t\_\{univ\}\$ is the age of the universe at a given redshift and remains roughly constant with stellar mass. Correlating {SFHs} with morphology, we find that studying the median {SFHs} of galaxies at \$0.5{\textless}z{\textless}1.0\$ at the same mass (\$10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textless} M\_* {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}\{10.5\}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$) allows us to compare the timescales on which the {SFHs} decline for different morphological classifications, ranging from \$0.60{\textasciicircum}\{-0.54\}\_\{+1.54\}\$ Gyr for galaxies with spiral arms to \$2.50{\textasciicircum}\{-1.50\}\_\{+2.25\}\$ Gyr for spheroids. The Gaussian Process-based {SFH} description provides a general approach to reconstruct smooth, nonparametric {SFH} posteriors for galaxies with a flexible number of parameters that can be incorporated into Bayesian {SED} fitting codes to minimize the bias in estimating physical parameters due to {SFH} parametrization.},

This is done using basis star formation histories ({SFHs}) chosen by comparing the goodness-of-ﬁt of mock galaxy {SEDs} to the goodness-of-reconstruction of their {SFHs}. We train and validate the method using a sample of realistic {SFHs} at z=1 drawn from stochastic realizations, semi-analytic models, and a cosmological hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulation. The method is then applied to a sample of 1100 {CANDELS} {GOODS}-S galaxies at 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.5 to illustrate its capabilities at moderate S/N with 15 photometric bands. Of the six parametrizations of {SFHs} considered, we adopt linear-exponential, besselexponential, log-normal, and Gaussian {SFHs}, and reject the traditional parametrizations of constant (Top-Hat) and exponential {SFHs}. We quantify the bias and scatter of each parametrization. 15\% of galaxies in our {CANDELS} sample exhibit multiple episodes of star formation, with this fraction decreasing above M* {\textgreater} 109.5 M. About 40\% of the {CANDELS} galaxies have {SFHs} whose maximum occurs at or near the epoch of observation.

Interpreting these data is a challenge for models: many studies have shown that properties derived from modeling galaxy photometry are uncertain by a factor of two or more, and yet answering key questions in the field now requires higher accuracy than this. Here, we present a new model framework specifically designed for these complexities. Our model, Prospector-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$, includes dust attenuation and re-radiation, a flexible attenuation curve, nebular emission, stellar metallicity, and a 6-component nonparametric star formation history. The flexibility and range of the parameter space, coupled with {MCMC} sampling within the Prospector inference framework, is designed to provide unbiased parameters and realistic error bars. We assess the accuracy of the model with aperture-matched optical spectroscopy, which was excluded from the fits. We compare spectral features predicted solely from fits to the broadband photometry to the observed spectral features. Our model predicts H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ luminosities with a scatter of \${\textbackslash}sim\$0.18 dex and an offset of \${\textbackslash}sim\$0.1 dex across a wide range of morphological types and stellar masses. This agreement is remarkable, as the H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ luminosity is dependent on accurate star formation rates, dust attenuation, and stellar metallicities. The model also accurately predicts dust-sensitive Balmer decrements, spectroscopic stellar metallicities, {PAH} mass fractions, and the age- and metallicity-sensitive features D\$\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{n\}\}\$4000 and H\${\textbackslash}delta\$. Although the model passes all these tests, we caution that we have not yet assessed its performance at higher redshift or the accuracy of recovered stellar masses.},

We point out that this simple observation can be used to deduce the existence of {DM} self-interactions by comparing the annihilation rates of {DM} gravitationally bound within the Sun and Earth. We compute the Sun and Earth annihilation ﬂuxes for {DM} with spin-independent nuclear cross-sections and thermal annihilation cross-sections and demonstrate that, for cross-sections allowed by direct detection, self-interactions can easily suppress the expected Earth ﬂux by multiple orders of magnitude. This suppression is potentially signiﬁcant even for self-interaction cross-sections orders of magnitude below the Bullet Cluster bounds, making this solar system comparison a leading test of dark matter self-interactions. Additionally, we consider thermalization of the captured {DM} population with the nuclei of the capturing body in some detail, accounting for both nuclear and self-interactions, and point out some consequential and broadly applicable considerations.},

We show that ﬁxing the metallicity in {SED} ﬁtting or using sparsely sampled metallicity grids can introduce mass-dependent systematics into stellar mass estimates. We ﬁnd that the common assumption of a star–dust geometry corresponding to a uniform foreground dust screen can cause the stellar masses of dusty model galaxies to be signiﬁcantly underestimated. Finally, we show that stellar mass functions recovered by applying {SED} ﬁtting to model galaxies at high redshift can differ signiﬁcantly in both shape and normalization from the intrinsic mass functions predicted by a given model. In particular, the effects of dust can reduce the normalization at the high-mass end by up to 0.6 dex in some cases. Given these differences, our methodology of using stellar masses estimated from model galaxy {SEDs} offers a new, self-consistent way to compare model predictions with observations.

Comparing stellar mass estimates from spatially resolved and spatially unresolved photometry we find that unresolved masses can be systematically underestimated by factors of up to 5. The ratio of the unresolved to resolved mass measurement depends on the galaxy's specific star formation rate ({sSFR}): at low {sSFRs} the bias is small, but above {sSFR}\${\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-9.5\}\$ yr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ the discrepancy increases rapidly such that galaxies with {sSFRs}\${\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-8\}\$ yr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ have unresolved mass estimates of only one half to one fifth of the resolved value. This result indicates that stellar masses estimated from spatially-unresolved datasets need to be systematically corrected, in some cases by large amounts, and we provide an analytic prescription for applying this correction. We show that correcting stellar mass measurements for this bias changes the normalization and slope of the star-forming main sequence and reduces its intrinsic width; most dramatically, correcting for the mass bias increases the stellar mass density of the Universe at high redshift and can resolve the long-standing discrepancy between the directly-measured cosmic star formation rate density at \$z{\textbackslash}gtrsim1\$ and that inferred from stellar mass densities ("the missing mass problem").},

Despite its cosmological nature, little h commonly appears in the measured properties of individual galaxies. This can pose unique challenges for users of such data, particularly with survey data. In this paper we show how little h arises in the measurement of galaxies, how to compare like-properties from different datasets that have assumed different little h cosmologies, and how to fairly compare theoretical data with observed data, where little h can manifest in vastly different ways. This last point is particularly important when observations are used to calibrate galaxy formation models, as calibrating with the wrong (or no) little h can lead to disastrous results when the model is later converted to the correct h cosmology. We argue that in this modern age little h is an anachronism, being one of least uncertain parameters in astrophysics, and we propose that observers and theorists instead treat this uncertainty like any other. We conclude with a "cheat sheet" of nine points that should be followed when dealing with little h in data analysis.},

In this review, we take a critical look at the case for {IMF} variations, with a view towards whether other explanations are sufficient given the evidence. Studies of the field, local young clusters and associations, and old globular clusters suggest that the vast majority were drawn from a "universal" {IMF}: a power-law of Salpeter index (\${\textbackslash}Gamma=1.35\$) above a few solar masses, and a log normal or shallower power-law (\${\textbackslash}Gamma {\textbackslash}sim 0-0.25\$) between a few tenths and a few solar masses (ignoring the effects of unresolved binaries). The shape and universality of the {IMF} at the stellar-substellar boundary is still under investigation and uncertainties remain large, but most observations are consistent with a {IMF} that declines (\${\textbackslash}Gamma {\textless} -0.5\$) well below the hydrogen burning limit. Observations of resolved stellar populations and the integrated properties of most galaxies are also consistent with a "universal {IMF}", suggesting no gross variations in the {IMF} over much of cosmic time. There are indications of "non-standard" {IMFs} in specific local and extragalactic environments, which clearly warrant further study. Nonetheless, there is no clear evidence that the {IMF} varies strongly and systematically as a function of initial conditions after the first few generations of stars.},

	abstract = {One of the most robust observations of the stellar initial mass function ({IMF}) is its near-universality in the Milky Way and neighboring galaxies. But recent observations of early-type galaxies can be interpreted to imply a bottom-heavy {IMF}, while others of ultra-faint dwarfs could imply a top-heavy {IMF}. This would impose powerful constraints on star formation models. We explore what sort of cloud-scale {IMF} models could possibly satisfy these constraints. We utilize simulated galaxies which reproduce (broadly) the observed galaxy properties, while they also provide the detailed star formation history and properties of each progenitor star-forming cloud. We then consider generic models where the characteristic mass of the {IMF} is some arbitrary power-law function of progenitor cloud properties, along with well-known literature {IMF} models, which scale with Jeans mass, turbulent Bonnor-Ebert mass, temperature, the opacity limit, metallicity, or the protostellar heating mass. We show that no {IMF} models currently in the literature - nor any model where the turnover mass is an arbitrary power-law function of a combination of cloud temperature/density/size/metallicity/velocity dispersion/magnetic field - can reproduce the claimed {IMF} variation in ellipticals or dwarfs without severely violating observational constraints in the Milky Way. Specifically, they predict too much variation in the extreme environments of the Galaxy, compared to that observed. Either the {IMF} varies in a more complicated manner, or alternative interpretations of the extragalactic observations must be explored.},

	abstract = {(shortened) In this contribution an average or Galactic-field {IMF} is defined, stressing that there is evidence for a change in the power-law index at only two masses: near 0.5 Msun and 0.08 Msun. Using this supposed universal {IMF}, the uncertainty inherent to any observational estimate of the {IMF} is investigated, by studying the scatter introduced by Poisson noise and the dynamical evolution of star clusters. It is found that this apparent scatter reproduces quite well the observed scatter in power-law index determinations, thus defining the fundamental limit within which any true variation becomes undetectable. Determinations of the power-law indices alpha are subject to systematic errors arising mostly from unresolved binaries. The systematic bias is quantified here, with the result that the single-star {IMFs} for young star-clusters are systematically steeper by d\_alpha=0.5 between 0.1 and 1 Msun than the Galactic-field {IMF}, which is populated by, on average, about 5 Gyr old stars. The {MFs} in globular clusters appear to be, on average, systematically flatter than the Galactic-field {IMF}, and the recent detection of ancient white-dwarf candidates in the Galactic halo and absence of associated low-mass stars suggests a radically different {IMF} for this ancient population. Star-formation in higher-metallicity environments thus appears to produce relatively more low-mass stars.},

As a general feature, the {IMF} is well described by a power-law form for \$m{\textbackslash}ga 1 {\textbackslash}msol\$ and a lognormal form below. The extension of the disk {IMF} into the brown dwarf ({BD}) regime is in good agreement with observations and yields a disk {BD} number-density comparable to the stellar one \${\textbackslash}sim 0.1 {\textbackslash}pc3\$. The {IMF} of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field {IMF}, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries. The spheroid {IMF} relies on much less robust grounds. Within all the uncertainties, it is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters, and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk. The {IMF} characteristic of early star formation remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below \${\textbackslash}sim 1 {\textbackslash}msol\$. These {IMFs} allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The M/L ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid {IMF} yield values 1.8 and 1.4 smaller than a Salpeter {IMF}, respectively. This general {IMF} determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. (shortened)},

	abstract = {One of the key observations regarding the stellar initial mass function ({IMF}) is its nearuniversality in the Milky Way ({MW}), which provides a powerful way to constrain different star formation models that predict the {IMF}. However, those models are almost universally ‘cloud-scale’ or smaller – they take as input or simulate single molecular clouds ({GMCs}), clumps or cores, and predict the resulting {IMF} as a function of the cloud properties. Without a model for the progenitor properties of all clouds that formed the stars at different locations in the {MW} (including ancient stellar populations formed in high redshift, likely gas-rich dwarf progenitor galaxies that looked little like the Galaxy today), the predictions cannot be fully explored nor safely applied to ‘live’ cosmological calculations of the {IMF} in different galaxies at different cosmological times. We therefore combine a suite of high-resolution cosmological simulations (from the Feedback In Realistic Environments project), which form {MW}-like galaxies with reasonable star formation properties and explicitly resolve massive {GMCs}, with various proposed cloud-scale {IMF} models. We apply the models independently to every star particle formed in the simulations to synthesize the predicted {IMF} in the present-day galaxy. We explore models where the {IMF} depends on Jeans mass, sonic or ‘turbulent Bonnor–Ebert’ mass, fragmentation with a polytropic equation of state, or where it is self-regulated by protostellar feedback. We show that all of these models, except the feedback-regulated ones, predict far more variation (∼0.6–1 dex 1σ scatter in the {IMF} turnover mass) in the simulations than is observed in the {MW}.},

	abstract = {The evolution of the galaxy stellar mass--star formation rate relationship (M*-{SFR}) provides key constraints on the stellar mass assembly histories of galaxies. For star-forming galaxies, M*-{SFR} is observed to be fairly tight with a slope close to unity from z{\textasciitilde}0-2. Simulations of galaxy formation reproduce these trends owing to the generic dominance of smooth and steady cold accretion in these systems. In contrast, the amplitude of the M*-{SFR} relation evolves markedly differently than in models. Stated in terms of a star formation activity parameter alpha=(M*/{SFR})/(t\_H-1 Gyr), models predict a constant alpha{\textasciitilde}1 out to redshifts z=4+, while the observed M*-{SFR} relation indicates that alpha increases by X3 from z{\textasciitilde}2 until today. The low alpha at high-z not only conflicts with models, but is also difficult to reconcile with other observations of high-z galaxies. Systematic biases could significantly affect measurements of M* and {SFR}, but detailed considerations suggest that none are obvious candidates to reconcile the discrepancy. A speculative solution is considered in which the stellar initial mass function ({IMF}) evolves towards more high-mass star formation at earlier epochs. Following Larson, a model is investigated in which the characteristic mass Mhat where the {IMF} turns over increases with redshift. The observed and predicted M*-{SFR} evolution may be brought into agreement if Mhat=0.5(1+z){\textasciicircum}2 Mo out to z{\textasciitilde}2. Such evolution broadly matches recent observations of cosmic stellar mass growth, and the resulting z=0 cumulative {IMF} is similar to the paunchy {IMF} favored by Fardal et al to reconcile the observed cosmic star formation history with present-day fossil light measures.

	abstract = {We present a new method for inferring galaxy star formation histories ({SFH}) using machine learning methods coupled with two cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, {EAGLE} and Illustris. We train Convolutional Neural Networks to learn the relationship between synthetic galaxy spectra and high resolution {SFHs}. To evaluate our {SFH} reconstruction we use Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error ({SMAPE}), which acts as a true percentage error in the low-error regime. On dust-attenuated spectra we achieve high test accuracy (median {SMAPE} = \$12.0{\textbackslash}\%\$). Including the effects of simulated experimental noise increases the error (\$13.2{\textbackslash}\%\$), however this is alleviated by including multiple realisations of the noise, which increases the training set size and reduces overfitting (\$11.4{\textbackslash}\%\$). We also make estimates for the experimental and modelling errors. To further evaluate the generalisation properties we apply models trained on one simulation to spectra from the other, which leads to only a small increase in the error (\${\textbackslash}sim 16{\textbackslash}\%\$). We apply each trained model to {SDSS} {DR}7 spectra, and find smoother histories than in the {VESPA} catalogue. This new approach complements the results of existing {SED} fitting techniques, providing star formation histories directly motivated by the results of the latest cosmological simulations.},

	abstract = {We present a unified description of the scenario of Global Hierarchical Collapse and fragmentation ({GHC}) in molecular clouds ({MCs}), owing to the continuous decrease of the average Jeans mass in the contracting cloud. {GHC} constitutes a regime of collapses within collapses, in which small-scale collapses begin at later times, but occur on shorter timescales than large-scale ones. The difference in timescales allows for most of the clouds' mass to be dispersed by feedback from the first massive stars, maintaining the global star formation rate low. All scales accrete from their parent structures. The main features of {GHC} are: star-forming {MCs} are in an essentially pressureless regime, which produces filaments that accrete onto clumps and cores ("hubs"). The filaments constitute the collapse flow from cloud to hub scales and may approach a quasi-stationary state; the molecular and dense mass fractions of the clouds increase over time; the first (low-mass) stars appear several Myr after global contraction began; more massive stars appear after a few Myr in massive hubs resulting from the collapse of larger scales; the minimum fragment mass may extend well into the brown-dwarf regime; Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion occurs at the protostellar and core scales, accounting for a near-Salpeter {IMF}; the extreme anisotropy of the filamentary network explains the difficulty in detecting large-scale infall signatures; the balance between inertial and gravitationally-driven motions in clumps evolves during the contraction; prestellar cores adopt Bonnor-Ebert-like profiles, but are contracting ever since early times when they may appear to be unbound and to require pressure confinement; stellar clusters develop radial age and mass segregation gradients. Finally, we discuss the incompatibility between supersonic turbulence and the observed scalings in the molecular hierarchy.},

Observing these structures during their period of active growth and assembly - the first few hundred million years of the Universe - is challenging because it requires surveys that are sensitive enough to detect the distant galaxies that act as signposts for these structures and wide enough to capture the rarest objects. As a result, very few such objects have been detected so far. Here we report observations of a far-infrared-luminous object at redshift 6.900 (less than 800 Myr after the Big Bang) that was discovered in a wide-field survey. High-resolution imaging reveals this source to be a pair of extremely massive star-forming galaxies. The larger of these galaxies is forming stars at a rate of 2900 solar masses per year, contains 270 billion solar masses of gas and 2.5 billion solar masses of dust, and is more massive than any other known object at a redshift of more than 6. Its rapid star formation is probably triggered by its companion galaxy at a projected separation of just 8 kiloparsecs. This merging companion hosts 35 billion solar masses of stars and has a star-formation rate of 540 solar masses per year, but has an order of magnitude less gas and dust than its neighbor and physical conditions akin to those observed in lower-metallicity galaxies in the nearby Universe. These objects suggest the presence of a dark-matter halo with a mass of more than 400 billion solar masses, making it among the rarest dark-matter haloes that should exist in the Universe at this epoch.},

Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a "generative model" for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are "nuisance parameters" to marginalize away.},

	abstract = {Although there has been much progress in understanding how galaxies evolve, we still do not understand how and when they stop forming stars and become quiescent. We address this by applying our galaxy spectral energy distribution models, which incorporate physically motivated star formation histories ({SFHs}) from cosmological simulations, to a sample of quiescent galaxies at \$0.2{\textless}z{\textless}2.1\$. A total of 845 quiescent galaxies with multi-band photometry spanning rest-frame ultraviolet through near-infrared wavelengths are selected from the {CANDELS} dataset. We compute median {SFHs} of these galaxies in bins of stellar mass and redshift. At all redshifts and stellar masses, the median {SFHs} rise, reach a peak, and then decline to reach quiescence. At high redshift, we find that the rise and decline are fast, as expected because the Universe is young. At low redshift, the duration of these phases depends strongly on stellar mass. Low-mass galaxies (\${\textbackslash}log(M\_\{{\textbackslash}ast\}/M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}){\textbackslash}sim9.5\$) grow on average slowly, take a long time to reach their peak of star formation (\${\textbackslash}gtrsim 4\$ Gyr), and the declining phase is fast (\${\textbackslash}lesssim 2\$ Gyr). Conversely, high-mass galaxies (\${\textbackslash}log(M\_\{{\textbackslash}ast\}/M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}){\textbackslash}sim11\$) grow on average fast (\${\textbackslash}lesssim 2\$ Gyr), and, after reaching their peak, decrease the star formation slowly (\${\textbackslash}gtrsim 3\$ Gyr). These findings are consistent with galaxy stellar mass being a driving factor in determining how evolved galaxies are, with high-mass galaxies being the most evolved at any time (i.e., downsizing). The different durations we observe in the declining phases also suggest that low- and high-mass galaxies experience different quenching mechanisms that operate on different timescales.},

	abstract = {We examine the star formation histories ({SFHs}) of galaxies in smoothed particle hydrodynamics ({SPH}) simulations, compare them to parametric models that are commonly used in fitting observed galaxy spectral energy distributions, and examine the efficacy of these parametric models as practical tools for recovering the physical parameters of galaxies. The commonly used tau-model, with {SFR} {\textasciitilde} exp(-t/tau), provides a poor match to the {SFH} of our {SPH} galaxies, with a mismatch between early and late star formation that leads to systematic errors in predicting colours and stellar mass-to-light ratios. A one-parameter lin-exp model, with {SFR} {\textasciitilde} t*exp(-t/tau), is much more successful on average, but it fails to match the late-time behavior of the bluest, most actively star-forming galaxies and the passive, "red and dead" galaxies. We introduce a 4-parameter model, which transitions from lin-exp to a linear ramp after a transition time, which describes our simulated galaxies very well. We test the ability of these parametrised models to recover (at z=0, 0.5, and 1) the stellar mass-to-light ratios, specific star formation rates, and stellar population ages from the galaxy colours, computed from the full {SPH} star formation histories using the {FSPS} code of Conroy et al. (2009). Fits with tau-models systematically overestimate M/L by {\textasciitilde} 0.2 dex, overestimate population ages by {\textasciitilde} 1-2 Gyr, and underestimate {sSFR} by {\textasciitilde} 0.05 dex. Fits with lin-exp are less biased on average, but the 4-parameter model yields the best results for the full range of galaxies. Marginalizing over the free parameters of the 4-parameter model leads to slightly larger statistical errors than 1-parameter fits but essentially removes all systematic biases, so this is our recommended procedure for fitting real galaxies.},

We select them in the near-{IR} bands of the {COSMOS}2015 catalogue, which includes ultra-deep photometry from {UltraVISTA}-{DR}2, {SPLASH}, and Subaru/Hyper-{SuprimeCam}. At \$z{\textgreater}2.5\$ we use new precise photometric redshifts with error \${\textbackslash}sigma\_z=0.03(1+z)\$ and an outlier fraction of \$12{\textbackslash}\%\$, estimated by means of the unique spectroscopic sample of {COSMOS}. The increased exposure time in the {DR}2, along with our panchromatic detection strategy, allow us to improve the stellar mass completeness at high \$z\$ with respect to previous {UltraVISTA} catalogues. We also identify passive galaxies through a robust colour-colour selection, extending their {SMF} estimate up to \$z=4\$. Our work provides a comprehensive view of galaxy stellar mass assembly between \$z=0.1\$ and 6, for the first time using consistent estimates across the entire redshift range. We fit these measurements with a Schechter function, correcting for Eddington bias. We compare the {SMF} fit with the halo mass function predicted from \${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM} simulations. We find that at \$z{\textgreater}3\$ both functions decline with a similar slope in the high-mass end. This feature could be explained assuming that the mechanisms that quench star formation in massive haloes become less effective at high redshift; however further work needs to be done to confirm this scenario. Concerning the {SMF} low-mass end, it shows a progressive steepening as moving towards higher redshifts, with \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ decreasing from \$-1.47\_\{-0.02\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.02\}\$ at \$z{\textbackslash}simeq0.1\$ to \$-2.11\_\{-0.13\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.30\}\$ at \$z{\textbackslash}simeq5\$. This slope depends on the characterisation of the observational uncertainties, which is crucial to properly remove the Eddington bias. We show that there is currently no consensus on the method to quantify such errors: different error models result in different best-fit Schechter parameters. [Abridged]},

	abstract = {Galaxy observations are influenced by many physical parameters: stellar masses, star formation rates ({SFRs}), star formation histories ({SFHs}), metallicities, dust, black hole activity, and more. As a result, inferring accurate physical parameters requires high-dimensional models which capture or marginalize over this complexity. Here we re-assess inferences of galaxy stellar masses and {SFRs} using the 14-parameter physical model Prospector-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ built in the Prospector Bayesian inference framework. We fit the photometry of 58,461 galaxies from the 3D-{HST} catalogs at \$0.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5\$. The resulting stellar masses are \${\textbackslash}sim0.1-0.3\$ dex larger than the fiducial masses while remaining consistent with dynamical constraints. This change is primarily due to the systematically older {SFHs} inferred with Prospector. The {SFRs} are \${\textbackslash}sim0.1-1+\$ dex lower than {UV}+{IR} {SFRs}, with the largest offsets caused by emission from "old" (\$t{\textgreater}100\$ Myr) stars. These new inferences lower the observed cosmic star formation rate density by \${\textbackslash}sim0.2\$ dex and increase the observed stellar mass growth by \${\textbackslash}sim 0.1\$ dex, finally bringing these two quantities into agreement and implying an older, more quiescent Universe than found by previous studies at these redshifts. We corroborate these results by showing that the Prospector-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ {SFHs} are both more physically realistic and are much better predictors of the evolution of the stellar mass function. Finally, we highlight examples of observational data which can break degeneracies in the current model; these observations can be incorporated into priors in future models to produce new \& more accurate physical parameters.},

The overall framework builds upon the successes of the Illustris galaxy formation model, and includes prescriptions for star formation, stellar evolution, chemical enrichment, primordial and metal-line cooling of the gas, stellar feedback with galactic outflows, and black hole formation, growth and multi-mode feedback. In this paper we give a comprehensive description of the physical and numerical advances which form the core of the {IllustrisTNG} (The Next Generation) framework. We focus on the revised implementation of the galactic winds, of which we modify the directionality, velocity, thermal content, and energy scalings, and explore its effects on the galaxy population. As described in earlier works, the model also includes a new black hole driven kinetic feedback at low accretion rates, magnetohydrodynamics, and improvements to the numerical scheme. Using a suite of (25 Mpc \$h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$)\${\textasciicircum}3\$ cosmological boxes we assess the outcome of the new model at our fiducial resolution. The presence of a self-consistently amplified magnetic field is shown to have an important impact on the stellar content of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{12\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm sun\}\$ haloes and above. Finally, we demonstrate that the new galactic winds promise to solve key problems identified in Illustris in matching observational constraints and affecting the stellar content and sizes of the low mass end of the galaxy population.},

	shorttitle = {Beyond {UVJ}},
	abstract = {The {UVJ} color-color diagram is a popular and efficient method to distinguish between quiescent and star-forming galaxies through their rest-frame \$U-V\$ vs. \$V-J\$ colors. Here we explore the information content of this color-color space using the Bayesian inference machine Prospector. We fit the same physical model to two datasets: (i) {UVJ} fluxes alone, and (ii) full {UV}-mid {IR} ({MIR}) broadband {SEDs} from the 3D-{HST} survey. Notably this model uses both nonparametric {SFHs} and a flexible dust attenuation curve, both of which have the potential to `break' the typical correlations observed in {UVJ} color-color space. Instead, these fits confirm observed trends between {UVJ} colors and observed galaxy properties, including specific star formation rate ({sSFR}), dust attenuation, stellar age, and stellar metallicity. They also demonstrate that {UVJ} colors do not, on their own, constrain stellar age or metallicity; the observed trends in the {UVJ} diagram are instead driven by galaxy scaling relationships and thus will evolve with cosmological time. We also show that {UVJ} colors 'saturate' below \${\textbackslash}log({\textbackslash}mathrm\{{sSFR}/yr\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}){\textbackslash}lesssim -10.5\$, i.e. changing {sSFR} no longer produces substantial changes in {UVJ} colors. We show that far-{UV} and/or {MIR} fluxes continue to correlate with {sSFR} down to low {sSFRs} and can be used in color-color diagrams to efficiently target galaxies with much lower levels of ongoing star formation. We provide selection criteria in these new color-color spaces as a function of desired sample {sSFR}.},

Based on similarities between the full {SED} shapes (0.3-8 micron), we have divided galaxies in 32 different spectral classes and stacked their photometry. As each class contains galaxies over a range in redshift, the resulting rest-frame {SEDs} are well-sampled in wavelength and show various spectral features including Halpha and the {UV} dust bump at 2175 Angstrom. We fit all composite {SEDs} with flexible stellar population synthesis models, while exploring attenuation curves with varying slopes and {UV} bump strengths. The Milky Way and Calzetti law provide poor fits at {UV} wavelengths for nearly all {SEDs}. Consistent with previous studies, we find that the best-fit attenuation law varies with spectral type. There is a strong correlation between the best-fit dust slope and {UV} bump strength, with steeper laws having stronger bumps. Moreover, the attenuation curve correlates with specific star formation rate ({SFR}), with more active galaxies having shallower dust curves and weaker bumps. There is also a weak correlation with inclination. The observed trends can be explained by differences in the dust-to-star geometry, a varying grain size distribution, or a combination of both. Our results have several implications for galaxy evolution studies. First, the assumption of a universal dust model leads to biases in derived galaxy properties. Second, the presence of a dust bump may result in underestimated values for the {UV} slope, used to correct {SFRs} of distant galaxies.},

	abstract = {We review the numerical techniques for ideal and non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamics ({MHD}) used in the context of star formation simulations. We outline the specific challenges offered by modeling star forming environments, which are dominated by supersonic and super-Alfvenic turbulence in a radiative, self-gravitating fluid. These conditions are rather unique in physics and engineering and pose particularly severe restrictions on the robustness and accuracy of numerical codes. One striking aspect is the formation of collapsing fluid elements leading to the formation of singularities that represent point-like objects, namely the proto-stars. Although a few studies have attempted to resolve the formation of the first and second Larson cores, resolution limitations force us to use sink particle techniques, with sub-grid models to compute the accretion rates of mass, momentum and energy, as well as their ejection rate due to radiation and jets from the proto-stars. We discuss the most popular discretisation techniques used in the community, namely smoothed particle hydrodynamics, finite difference and finite volume methods, stressing the importance to maintain a divergence-free magnetic field. We discuss how to estimate the truncation error of a given numerical scheme, and its importance in setting the magnitude of the numerical diffusion. This can have a strong impact on the outcome of these {MHD} simulations, where both viscosity and resistivity are implemented at the grid scale. We then present various numerical techniques to model non-ideal {MHD} effects, such as Ohmic and ambipolar diffusion, as well as the Hall effect. These important physical ingredients are posing strong challenges in term of resolution and time stepping. For the latter, several strategies are discussed to overcome the limitations due to prohibitively small time steps (abridged).},

	abstract = {A diverse range of dust attenuation laws is found in star-forming galaxies. In particular, Tress et al. (2018) studied the {SHARDS} survey to constrain the {NUV} bump strength (B) and the total-to selective ratio (Rv) of 1,753 star-forming galaxies in the {GOODS}-N field at 1.5{\textless}z{\textless}3. We revisit here this sample to assess the implications and possible causes of the correlation found between Rv and B. The {UVJ} bicolour plot and main sequence of star formation are scrutinised to look for clues into the observed trend. The standard boundary between quiescent and star-forming galaxies is preserved when taking into account the wide range of attenuation parameters. However, an additional degeneracy, regarding the effective attenuation law, is added to the standard loci of star-forming galaxies in the {UVJ} diagram. A simple phenomenological model with an age-dependent extinction (at fixed dust composition) is compatible with the observed trend between Rv and B, whereby the opacity decreases with the age of the populations, resulting in a weaker {NUV} bump when the overall attenuation is shallower (greyer). In addition, we compare the constraints obtained by the {SHARDS} sample with dust models from the literature, supporting a scenario where geometry could potentially drive the correlation between Rv and B},

	abstract = {The attenuation of starlight by interstellar dust is investigated in a sample of low redshift, disk-dominated star-forming galaxies using photometry from {GALEX} and {SDSS}. By considering broadband colors as a function of galaxy inclination we are able to confidently separate trends arising from increasing dust opacity from possible differences in stellar populations, since stellar populations do not correlate with inclination. All commonly employed dust attenuation curves (such as the Calzetti curve for starbursts, or a power-law curve) provide poor fits to the ultraviolet colors for moderately and highly inclined galaxies. This conclusion rests on the fact that the average {FUV}-{NUV} color varies little from face-on to edge-on galaxies, while other colors such as {NUV}-u and u-r vary strongly with inclination. After considering a number of model variations, we are led to speculate that the presence of the strong dust extinction feature at 2175A seen in the Milky Way ({MW}) extinction curve is responsible for the observed trends. Independent of our interpretation, these results imply that the modeling of dust attenuation in the ultraviolet is significantly more complicated than traditionally assumed. These results also imply a very weak dependence of the {FUV}-{NUV} color on total {FUV} attenuation, and we conclude from this that it is extremely difficult to use only the observed {UV} spectral slope to infer the total {UV} dust attenuation, as is commonly done. We propose several simple tests that might finally identify the grain population responsible for the 2175A feature.},

This technique provides a powerful measure of particular extinction features such as the {UV} bump at 2175{\textbackslash}A, which has been observed in environments ranging from the Milky Way to high-redshift star-forming galaxies. Knowledge of the typical strength of the {UV} bump as a function of environment and redshift is crucial for converting restframe {UV} flux into star formation rates. The {UV} bump will impart a unique signature as it moves through various filters due to redshifting; its presence can therefore be disentangled from other stellar population effects. The utility of this technique is demonstrated with a large sample of galaxies drawn from the {DEEP}2 Galaxy Redshift Survey. The observed B-R color of star-forming galaxies at 0.6{\textless}z{\textless}1.4 disfavors the presence of a {UV} bump as strong as observed in the Milky Way, and instead favors restframe {UV} (1800A{\textless}lambda{\textless}3000A) attenuation curves similar to the Milky Way without a {UV} bump or a power-law with index delta=-0.7. Stronger constraints on the strength of the {UV} bump in galaxies can be achieved if independent constraints on the V-band optical depth are available.},

We compute median-likelihood estimates of these parameters using a large library of model spectra at medium-high resolution, covering a comprehensive range of star formation histories. The constraints we derive are set by the simultaneous fit of five spectral absorption features, which are well reproduced by our population synthesis models. By design, these constraints depend only weakly on the alpha/Fe element abundance ratio. Our sample includes galaxies of all types spanning the full range in star formation activity, from dormant early-type to actively star-forming galaxies. We show that, in the mean, galaxies follow a sequence of increasing stellar metallicity, age and stellar mass at increasing 4000AA-break strength (D4000). For galaxies of intermediate mass, stronger Balmer absorption at fixed D4000 is associated with higher metallicity and younger age. We investigate how stellar metallicity and age depend on total galaxy stellar mass. Low-mass galaxies are typically young and metal-poor, massive galaxies old and metal-rich, with a rapid transition between these regimes over the stellar mass range 3x10{\textasciicircum}9{\textless}M/Msun{\textless}3x10{\textasciicircum}10. Both high- and low-concentration galaxies follow these relations, but there is a large dispersion in stellar metallicity at fixed stellar mass, especially for low-concentration galaxies of intermediate mass. Despite the large scatter, the relation between stellar metallicity and stellar mass is similar to the correlation between gas-phase oxygen abundance and stellar mass for star-forming galaxies.

	abstract = {We explore the dependence of galaxy stellar population properties that are derived from broad-band spectral energy distribution ﬁtting – such as age, stellar mass, dust reddening, etc. – on a variety of parameters, such as star formation histories, age grid, metallicity, initial mass function ({IMF}), dust reddening and reddening law, ﬁlter setup and wavelength coverage. Mock galaxies are used as test particles. We conﬁrm our earlier results based on real z = 2 galaxies, that usually adopted τ -models lead to overestimate the star formation rate and to underestimate the stellar mass. Here, we show that – for star-forming galaxies – galaxy ages, masses and reddening can be well determined simultaneously only when the correct star formation history is identiﬁed. This is the case for inverted-τ models at high-z, for which we ﬁnd that the mass recovery (at ﬁxed {IMF}) is as good as ∼0.04 dex. However, since the right star formation history is usually unknown, we quantify the offsets generated by adopting standard ﬁtting setups. Stellar masses are generally underestimated, which results from underestimating the age. For mixed ﬁtting setups with a variety of star formation histories the median mass recovery at z ∼ 2–3 is as decent as ∼0.1 dex (at ﬁxed {IMF}), albeit with large scatter. The situation worsens towards lower redshifts, because of the variety of possible star formation histories and ages. At z ∼ 0.5 the stellar mass can be underestimated by as much as ∼0.6 dex (at ﬁxed {IMF}). A practical trick to improve upon this ﬁgure is to exclude reddening from the ﬁtting parameters, as this helps to avoid unrealistically young and dusty solutions. Stellar masses are underestimated by a smaller amount (∼0.3 dex at z ∼ 0.5). Reddening and the star formation rate should then be determined via a separate ﬁtting. As expected, the recovery of properties is better for passive galaxies, for which e.g. the mass can be fully recovered (within ∼0.01 dex at ﬁxed {IMF}) when using a ﬁtting setup including metallicity effects. In both cases of star-forming as well as passive galaxies, the recovery of physical parameters is dependent on the spectral range involved in the ﬁtting. We ﬁnd that a coverage from the rest-frame ultraviolet to the rest-frame near-infrared appears to be optimal. We also quantify the effect of narrowing the wavelength coverage or adding and removing ﬁlter bands, which can be useful for planning observational surveys. Finally, we provide scaling relations that allow the transformation of stellar masses obtained using different template ﬁtting setups and stellar population models.},

The present work is the first in a series that explores the impact of uncertainties in key phases of stellar evolution and the {IMF} on the derived physical properties of galaxies and the expected luminosity evolution for a passively evolving set of stars. A Monte-Carlo Markov-Chain approach is taken to fit near-{UV} through near-{IR} photometry of a representative sample of low- and high-redshift galaxies with this new {SPS} model. Significant results include the following: 1) including uncertainties in stellar evolution, stellar masses at z{\textasciitilde}0 carry errors of {\textasciitilde}0.3 dex at 95\% {CL} with little dependence on luminosity or color, while at z{\textasciitilde}2, the masses of bright red galaxies are uncertain at the {\textasciitilde}0.6 dex level; 2) either current stellar evolution models, current observational stellar libraries, or both, do not adequately characterize the metallicity-dependence of the thermally-pulsating asymptotic giant branch phase; 3) conservative estimates on the uncertainty of the slope of the {IMF} in the solar neighborhood imply that luminosity evolution per unit redshift is uncertain at the {\textasciitilde}0.4 mag level in the K-band, which is a substantial source of uncertainty for interpreting the evolution of galaxy populations across time; 4) The more plausible assumption of a distribution of stellar metallicities, rather than a fixed value as is usually assumed, can have significant effects on the interpretation of colors blueward of the V-band.

	abstract = {Photometric data of galaxies covering the rest-frame wavelength range from far-{UV} to far-{IR} make it possible to derive galaxy properties with a high reliability by fitting the attenuated stellar emission and the related dust emission at the same time. For this purpose we wrote the code {CIGALE} (Code Investigating {GALaxy} Emission) that uses model spectra composed of the Maraston (or {PEGASE}) stellar population models, synthetic attenuation functions based on a modified Calzetti law, spectral line templates, the Dale \& Helou dust emission models, and optional spectral templates of obscured {AGN}. Depending on the input redshifts, filter fluxes are computed for the model set and compared to the galaxy photometry by carrying out a Bayesian-like analysis. {CIGALE} was tested by analysing 39 nearby galaxies selected from {SINGS}. The reliability of the different model parameters was evaluated by studying the resulting expectation values and their standard deviations in relation to the input model grid. Moreover, the influence of the filter set and the quality of photometric data on the code results was estimated. For up to 17 filters between 0.15 and 160 mum, we find robust results for the mass, star formation rate, effective age of the stellar population at 4000 A, bolometric luminosity, luminosity absorbed by dust, and attenuation in the far-{UV}. A study of the mutual relations between the reliable properties confirms the dependence of star formation activity on morphology in the local Universe and indicates a significant drop in this activity at about 10{\textasciicircum}11 M\_sol towards higher total stellar masses.

Our model adapts the two component screen model of Charlot \& Fall (2000), parametrising the optical depth and slope of the {ISM} screen using the average dust surface density, \${\textbackslash}Sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}rm dust\}\$. We recover relatively tight relations between these parameters for the {EAGLE} sample, but also provide the scatter in these parameter owing to the morphological variation and orientation of galaxies. We also find that these relations are nearly independent of redshift in the {EAGLE} model. By pairing our model with an empirical prescription for birth clouds below the resolution scale of the simulation, we reproduce the observed relation between attenuation slope and optical depth for the first time in a cosmological simulation.

	abstract = {We examine the growth of the stellar content of galaxies from z=3-0 in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations incorporating parameterised galactic outflows. Without outflows, galaxies overproduce stellar masses (M*) and star formation rates ({SFRs}) compared to observations. Winds introduce a three-tier form for the galaxy stellar mass and star formation rate functions, where the middle tier depends on differential (i.e. mass-dependent) recycling of ejected wind material back into galaxies. A tight M*-{SFR} relation is a generic outcome of all these simulations, and its evolution is well-described as being powered by cold accretion, although current observations at z{\textgreater}2 suggest that star formation in small early galaxies must be highly suppressed. Roughly one-third of z=0 galaxies at masses below M{\textasciicircum}* are satellites, and star formation in satellites is not much burstier than in centrals. All models fail to suppress star formation and stellar mass growth in massive galaxies at z{\textless}2, indicating the need for an external quenching mechanism such as black hole feedback. All models also fail to produce dwarfs as young and rapidly star-forming as observed. An outflow model following scalings expected for momentum-driven winds broadly matches observed galaxy evolution around M{\textasciicircum}* from z=0-3, which is a significant success since these galaxies dominate cosmic star formation, but the failures at higher and lower masses highlight the challenges still faced by this class of models. We argue that central star-forming galaxies are well-described as living in a slowly-evolving equilibrium between inflows from gravity and recycled winds, star formation, and strong and ubiquitous outflows that regulate how much inflow forms into stars. Star-forming galaxy evolution is thus primarily governed by the continual cycling of baryons between galaxies and intergalactic gas.},

The `coming of age' of large ground-based surveys and the unprecedented sensitivity, angular resolution and/or field-of-view of infrared and ultraviolet space missions have provided extensive, homogeneous data on both nearby and distant galaxies, which have been used to further our understanding of the strengths and pitfalls of many common star formation rate indicators. The synergy between these surveys has also enabled the calibration of indicators for use on scales that are comparable to those of star-forming regions, thus much smaller than an entire galaxy.

Considering a sample of 2,239 local spiral galaxies in optical ({SDSS} u, g, r, i, and z) and infrared bands ({WISE} W1, W1), we study the dependency of the global intrinsic attenuation in spiral galaxies on their morphologies, sizes, and spatial inclinations. Reddening is minimal at the extremes of low mass and gas depletion and maximal in galaxies that are relatively massive and metal-rich and still retain substantial gas reserves. A principal component constructed from observables that monitor galaxy mass, relative {HI} content to old stars, and infrared surface brightness is strongly correlated with the amplitude of obscuration. We determine both a parametric model for dust obscuration and a non-parametric model based on the Gaussian process formalism.

	abstract = {The attenuation of starlight by interstellar dust is investigated in a sample of low redshift, disk-dominated star-forming galaxies using photometry from {GALEX} and {SDSS}. By considering broadband colors as a function of galaxy inclination we are able to confidently separate trends arising from increasing dust opacity from possible differences in stellar populations, since stellar populations do not correlate with inclination. All commonly employed dust attenuation curves (such as the Calzetti curve for starbursts, or a power-law curve) provide poor fits to the ultraviolet colors for moderately and highly inclined galaxies. This conclusion rests on the fact that the average {FUV}-{NUV} color varies little from face-on to edge-on galaxies, while other colors such as {NUV}-u and u-r vary strongly with inclination. After considering a number of model variations, we are led to speculate that the presence of the strong dust extinction feature at 2175A seen in the Milky Way ({MW}) extinction curve is responsible for the observed trends. Independent of our interpretation, these results imply that the modeling of dust attenuation in the ultraviolet is significantly more complicated than traditionally assumed. These results also imply a very weak dependence of the {FUV}-{NUV} color on total {FUV} attenuation, and we conclude from this that it is extremely difficult to use only the observed {UV} spectral slope to infer the total {UV} dust attenuation, as is commonly done. We propose several simple tests that might finally identify the grain population responsible for the 2175A feature.},

This survey, {AS}2UDS, identified 707 {SMGs} across the {\textasciitilde}1 sq.deg. field, including {\textasciitilde}17 per cent which are undetected in the optical/near-infrared to \$K\${\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}25.7 mag. We interpret the {UV}-to-radio data using a physically motivated model, {MAGPHYS} and determine a median photometric redshift of z=2.61+-0.08, with a 68th percentile range of z=1.8-3.4 and just {\textasciitilde}6 per cent at z{\textgreater}4. The redshift distribution is well fit by a model combining evolution of the gas fraction in halos with the growth of halo mass past a threshold of {\textasciitilde}4x10\${\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, thus {SMGs} may represent the highly efficient collapse of gas-rich massive halos. Our survey provides a sample of the most massive, dusty galaxies at z{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}1, with median dust and stellar masses of \$M\_d\$=(6.8+-0.3)x10\${\textasciicircum}\{8\}\$M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ (thus, gas masses of {\textasciitilde}10\${\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$) and \$M\_{\textbackslash}ast=\$(1.26+-0.05)x10\${\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. These galaxies have gas fractions of \$f\_\{gas\}=\$0.41+-0.02 with depletion timescales of {\textasciitilde}150Myr. The gas mass function evolution at high masses is consistent with constraints at lower masses from blind {CO}-surveys, with an increase to z{\textasciitilde}2-3 and then a decline at higher redshifts. The space density and masses of {SMGs} suggests that almost all galaxies with \$M\_{\textbackslash}ast\${\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}2x10\${\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ have passed through an {SMG}-like phase. We find no evolution in dust temperature at a constant far-infrared luminosity across z{\textasciitilde}1.5-4. We show that {SMGs} appear to behave as simple homologous systems in the far-infrared, having properties consistent with a centrally illuminated starburst. Our study provides strong support for an evolutionary link between the active, gas-rich {SMG} population at z{\textgreater}1 and the formation of massive, bulge-dominated galaxies across the history of the Universe.},

	abstract = {Establishing the stellar masses (M*), and hence specific star-formation rates ({sSFRs}) of submillimetre galaxies ({SMGs}) is crucial for determining their role in the cosmic galaxy/star formation. However, there is as yet no consensus over the typical M* of {SMGs}. Specifically, even for the same set of {SMGs}, the reported average M* have ranged over an order of magnitude, from {\textasciitilde}5x10{\textasciicircum}10 Mo to {\textasciitilde}5x10{\textasciicircum}11 Mo. Here we study how different methods of analysis can lead to such widely varying results. We find that, contrary to recent claims in the literature, potential contamination of {IRAC} 3-8 um photometry from hot dust associated with an active nucleus is not the origin of the published discrepancies in derived M*. Instead, we expose in detail how inferred M* depends on assumptions made in the photometric fitting, and quantify the individual and cumulative effects of different choices of initial mass function, different brands of evolutionary synthesis models, and different forms of assumed star-formation history. We review current observational evidence for and against these alternatives as well as clues from the hydrodynamical simulations, and conclude that, for the most justifiable choices of these model inputs, the average M* of {SMGs} is {\textasciitilde}2x10{\textasciicircum}11 Mo. We also confirm that this number is perfectly reasonable in the light of the latest measurements of their dynamical masses, and the evolving M* function of the overall galaxy population. M* of this order imply that the average {sSFR} of {SMGs} is comparable to that of other star-forming galaxies at z{\textgreater}2, at 2-3 Gyr{\textasciicircum}-1. This supports the view that, while rare outliers may be found at any M*, most {SMGs} simply form the top end of the main-sequence of star-forming galaxies at these redshifts. Conversely, this argues strongly against the viewpoint that {SMGs} are extreme pathological objects, of little relevance in the cosmic history of star-formation.},

The z=0 {DGR} vs metallicity relationship shows a tight positive correlation for star-forming galaxies, while it is uncorrelated for quenched systems. There is little evolution in the {DGR}-metallicity relationship between z=0-6. We use machine learning techniques to search for the galaxy physical properties that best correlate with the {DGR} and {DTM}. We find that the {DGR} is primarily correlated with the gas-phase metallicity, though correlations with the depletion timescale, stellar mass and gas fraction are non-negligible.

We compute median-likelihood estimates of these parameters using a large library of model spectra at medium-high resolution, covering a comprehensive range of star formation histories. The constraints we derive are set by the simultaneous fit of five spectral absorption features, which are well reproduced by our population synthesis models. By design, these constraints depend only weakly on the alpha/Fe element abundance ratio. Our sample includes galaxies of all types spanning the full range in star formation activity, from dormant early-type to actively star-forming galaxies. We show that, in the mean, galaxies follow a sequence of increasing stellar metallicity, age and stellar mass at increasing 4000AA-break strength (D4000). For galaxies of intermediate mass, stronger Balmer absorption at fixed D4000 is associated with higher metallicity and younger age. We investigate how stellar metallicity and age depend on total galaxy stellar mass. Low-mass galaxies are typically young and metal-poor, massive galaxies old and metal-rich, with a rapid transition between these regimes over the stellar mass range 3x10{\textasciicircum}9{\textless}M/Msun{\textless}3x10{\textasciicircum}10. Both high- and low-concentration galaxies follow these relations, but there is a large dispersion in stellar metallicity at fixed stellar mass, especially for low-concentration galaxies of intermediate mass. Despite the large scatter, the relation between stellar metallicity and stellar mass is similar to the correlation between gas-phase oxygen abundance and stellar mass for star-forming galaxies.
